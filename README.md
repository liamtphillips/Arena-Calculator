# Arena-Calculator
Points calculator for World of Warcraft TBC / WOTLK ((Not classic))


In World of Warcraft players are able to create a team and fight other players in an arena. Teams gain or lose rating depending on whether they win or lose, similar to the Elo rating system used in chess. Players that participate in arena battles receive points each week which they are able to spend on upgrading their character's equipment. The higher a team's rating, the more points a player will receive. Players will only receive points from one team, 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 - depending on which team yields the highest points.

This calculator can be used to work out how many points a player is going to receive. Simply enter a rating and select a team size. Choose TBC or WOTLK depending on which game version you are playing.

Arena team ratings are typically between 1300 - 2500
